## \#\# üöÄ How to Run Locally

This project uses JavaScript Modules, which require a server environment to run due to browser security policies (CORS). You cannot run it by simply opening the `index.html` file.

The easiest way is to use the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code.

1.  **Install VS Code**: If you don't have it, download it from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2.  **Install Live Server Extension**: In VS Code, go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), search for `Live Server`, and install it.
3.  **Run the Server**: Right-click on the `index.html` file in the VS Code explorer and select "**Open with Live Server**". Your browser will automatically open with the project running.
